HEVC still image coding and high efficiency image file format
The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard includes support for a large range of image representation formats and provides an excellent image compression capability. The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) offers a convenient way to encapsulate HEVC coded images, image sequences and animations together with associated metadata into a single file. This paper discusses various features and functionalities of the HEIF file format and compares the compression efficiency of HEVC still image coding to that of JPEG 2000. According to the experimental results HEVC provides about 25% bitrate reduction compared to JPEG 2000, while keeping the same objective picture quality.
