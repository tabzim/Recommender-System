Path-based image sequence interpolation guided by feature points
We present a method of image sequence interpolation, which can generate a sequence of continuous intermediate frames between two input images. This method is based on a path framework that describes the motion information in the images. A path which starts from one input image, and ends at another input image is constructed for each pixel in the images. The main contribution of this paper is that we take the feature points into consideration. By calculating the position deviation out of the feature points, information and guidance can be given to the process of path optimization, making the interpolation result more plausible and natural. We also increase the conditions and restrictions in the optimization procedure, hence the time and memory cost can be effectively decreased.
