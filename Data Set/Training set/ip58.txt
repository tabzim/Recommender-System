Novel tile segmentation scheme for omnidirectional video
Regular omnidirectional video encoding technics use map projection to flatten a scene from a spherical shape into one or several 2D shapes. Common projection methods including equirectangular and cubic projection have varying levels of interpolation that create a large number of non-information-carrying pixels that lead to wasted bitrate. In this paper, we propose a tile based omnidirectional video segmentation scheme which can save up to 28% of pixel area and 20% of BD-rate averagely compared to the traditional equirectangular projection based approach.
