3D tele-immersion platform for interactive immersive experiences between remote users
Tele-immersion (TI) related technologies can change the way people interact and bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. However, while the technology itself advances, most developed platforms have complex setups and require large investments. In this work, a low-cost platform is introduced, integrating multiple TI-related advances. Focusing on ease of use and rapid deployment, a fast and fully automatic calibration method is proposed. The platform enables real-time 3D reconstruction of users and their placement into a pre-authored 3D environment. Moreover, interaction is achieved through the user's body posture, removing the need for additional equipment and enabling natural control while immersed. Developing a real-time TI platform requires the efficient integration of several multidisciplinary elements. An elegant, minimal solution to these challenges is proposed and validated in a prototype TI multiplayer game, SpaceWars.
