No-reference perceptual sharpness assessment for ultra-high-definition images
Since ultra-high-definition (UHD) display has larger resolution and various display size, it is necessary to measure image sharpness considering variation in visual resolution caused by diverse viewing geometry. In this paper, we propose a no-reference perceptual sharpness assessment model of UHD images. The proposed model analyzes viewing geometry in terms of display resolution and viewing environment. Then, we measure the local adaptive sharpness score in accordance with the textural motion blur, texture, and edge. In addition, we propose a spatial pooling method associated with foveal regions, which is caused by nonuniform distribution of the photoreceptors on a human retina. Through the rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model can measure the sharpness of UHD images more accurately than other image sharpness assessment methods.
