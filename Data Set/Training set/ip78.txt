Automatic creation of magazine-page-like social media visual summary for mobile browsing
Today, mobile users are struggling with accessing overloading and unstructured social media feeds on the severely constrained mobile display. To overcome the challenges associated with browsing social media feeds on mobile devices, we are developing an innovative scheme to automatically create and synthesize the mixed social media digest (pictures, texts and videos) into a magazine-page-like social media visual summary. Given a set of personalized social media digest, a multi-objective optimization is formulated to organize the digest into visual summary in a 9-block-partition fashion with consideration of informative delivery, aesthetic rules and visual perception principles. Each block will be optimized interactively in terms of size, position and color to best represent the overall social media digest. Extensive evaluation and analysis based on user studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in presenting social media content in a visually appealing and compact way. It is expected that this visual summary will lead to much enhanced user experiences for browsing social media digest on mobile devices.
