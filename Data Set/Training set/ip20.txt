Real-time video summarization on mobile
This paper proposes a novel approach for real-time video summarization on mobile using Dictionary Learning, Global Camera Motion analysis and Colorfulness. A dictionary is represented as a distinct set of events that are described as spatio-temporal features. Uniqueness measure is predicted based on the correlation scores of the dictionary elements whereas the quality measure is estimated using Global Camera Motion analysis and Colorfulness. Our proposed technique combines the uniqueness measure and the quality measure to predict the interestingness. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts in terms of computation speed while retaining the similar subjective quality.
