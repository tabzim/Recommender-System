ISURE: User authentication in mobile devices using ocular biometrics in visible spectrum
In this paper, we propose a supervised learning based model for ocular biometrics. Using Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) for detecting local features of the eye region, we create a local feature descriptor vector of each image. We cluster these feature vectors, representing an image as a normalized histogram of membership to various clusters, thereby creating a bag-of-visual-words model. We conduct a multiphase training, first performing a fast Multinomial Nai?ve Bayes learning, and subsequently using a pyramid-up topology to use the top k% results (based upon confidence scores) thus predicted and perform Dense SIFT for nearest neighbor matching. Contrary to traditional ocular biometric systems, our proposed approach does not rely highly accurate iris pattern segmentation, allowing less constrained image acquisition conditions such as from mobile devices. Our method identifies the individuals with an identification accuracy varying from 48.76% to 79.49%, across different lighting conditions and phone handset data sources, while testing on the given data.
